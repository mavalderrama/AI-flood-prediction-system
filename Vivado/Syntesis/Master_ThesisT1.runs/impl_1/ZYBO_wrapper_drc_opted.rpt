DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP ZYBO_i/TOPANN_0/inst/p_Val2_2_fu_961_p2 output ZYBO_i/TOPANN_0/inst/p_Val2_2_fu_961_p2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.
